# To start OS 1)must go to folder "opens" input in terminal "nano Ammkernel.c" 
# 2)then search variable un -> 'char un[22] = ""; ' you must full this array with 
# your Linux user name example => 'char un[22] = "adduser";' file has 1 "un" more 
# array please fill it with your Linux user name!
# 3)then exit file with "Ctrl + o" + "Ctrl + x" (nano); "ECS" + ":wq"(vim) 
# 4)after that compile OS -> "gcc Ammshell.c Ammkernel.c -o Ammshell"
# then go to folder AmmOS and write "nano run" write your Linux username to pass
# save and exit. now you can run AmmOS! -> "./run" good luck ;)
