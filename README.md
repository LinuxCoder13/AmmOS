# AmmSH-scripts

AmmSH interpreter supports basic commands:

1. `if ... else ... endif`  
   Conditional execution based on the result of a command.  
   Example: `if r test.txt` ‚Äì if the command `r test.txt` doesn't return 1 (i.e., it succeeds), the `if` block is executed.  
   - Cannot contain nested `if ... else` blocks.

2. `loop ... endloop`  
   Repeats a block of code a specified number of times.  
   - Cannot contain `if ... else` inside.

3. `if` + shell commands  
   Example: `if go ..`

4. One-line commands  
   Example: `go ..`

---

## Rules

1. No variables allowed  
2. Interpret script using: `AmmSH [file_name]`  
3. No nested `if` or `loop` blocks allowed

---

## Code Example

```ammsh
if go ..
    print I went 1 dir back!
else
    print fail!
endif

loop 10
    neofetch
endloop
